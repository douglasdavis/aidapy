Description
===========

Under construction. More documentation to come.

Setup
=====

To set up in an ``lxplus`` like environment

.. code-block:: bash

   $ source lxsetup.sh


This will simply set up a proper python path and set up some extra
python packages through the ``sft.cern.ch`` ``cvmfs`` area.


In a local environment we can simply use ``pip``:

   $ pip install .

Or just set add this directory to your python path.
